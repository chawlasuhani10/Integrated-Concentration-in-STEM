# Integrated-Concentration-in-STEM (ICONS
I am a part of UMass Amherst's 12th cohort of ICONS (20-credits) along with 70 other students. 
Here's an excerpt from ICONS website: https://icons.cns.umass.edu/ 
to give you an insight into what ICONS is.

"The iCons Program is at the cutting-edge of integrative education, bringing together undergraduate students from all walks of science, engineering, public heath, and business to:

1. Collaborate on complex societal issues in diverse teams;
2. Understand multi-faceted problems from multi-disciplinary perspectives; and
3. Develop and study creative solutions to real-world challenges.
Building on the disciplinary strength of each student’s major, the 20-credit iCons curriculum consists of one course per year over four years, culminating in world-class research experiences. iCons projects involve student teamwork on case studies, laboratory experiments, and research – all fostering cross-disciplinary communication and integrative problem-solving skills. After the first year, each student chooses a track in either Biomedicine/Biosystems or Renewable Energy. A new concentration in the area of Food, Water, and Climate is being developed. Students apply to the program as freshmen or sophomore and are taught by an interdisciplinary team of professors and experts in their fields."
